# Homework 04: Tidy data and joins

This is the repository for STAT545A HW 04 which focuses on data wrangling skills by working on problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.

There are two parts to this assignment:

1) Pick one of the data reshaping prompts and do it.

I chose to make my own cheatsheet similar to [Tyler Rinker’s minimal guide to tidyr](https://github.com/trinker/tidyr_in_a_nutshell).

2) Pick one of the join prompts and do it.

I chose Activity #2 which was to create my own cheatsheet patterned after Jenny’s but focused on something I care about (other than comics)!
