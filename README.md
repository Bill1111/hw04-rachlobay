# Homework 04: Tidy data and joins

This is the repository for STAT545A HW 04 which focuses on data wrangling skills by working on problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.

There are two parts to this assignment:

1) Pick one of the data reshaping prompts and do it.

I chose to make my own cheatsheet similar to [Tyler Rinkerâ€™s minimal guide to tidyr](https://github.com/trinker/tidyr_in_a_nutshell).

2) Pick one of the join prompts and do it.

I chose to "Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:
  - One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capital city.
  - One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern hemisphere.
